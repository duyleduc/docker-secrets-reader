**Description:**
The Docker Secrets Reader is a lightweight Node.js module designed to simplify the process of accessing Docker secrets within Docker containers. Docker secrets are sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential information stored securely within Docker Swarm or Docker Compose.

**Key Features:**

1. **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrates into Node.js applications running within Docker containers, providing a convenient interface for accessing Docker secrets.

2. **Simple API:** Offers a simple and intuitive API for reading Docker secrets, abstracting away the complexities of interacting with Docker's secret management system.

3. **Environment Variable Support:** Provides support for accessing Docker secrets through environment variables, allowing developers to easily inject secrets into their applications.

**Usage:**
Created your docker secret for a docker swarm 
```shell
printf "mysql_username" | docker secret create mysql_username - 
printf "mysql_password" | docker secret create mysql_password -
```

```javascript
import {secrets} from 'docker-secrets-reader';

console.log(secrets.mysql_username);
# mysql_username
```

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install docker-secret-reader
```

**Compatibility:**
- Compatible with Node.js applications running in Docker containers.
- Works with Docker Swarm and Docker Compose for managing secrets.

**Dependencies:**
